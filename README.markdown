Realtime Sensor Graphing for Android
====================================

This is a project fork from <a href="https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView-Demos">https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView-Demos</a>

If you need a graphing library - pull the code from JJoe64. 

This code is merely to demonstrate realtime data handling.  It pulls data from the accelerometer and can parse data from a serial stream over bluetooth.
